The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`.\n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"QIpyBSfdcMjJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define where you are running the code: colab or local\n","RunInColab          = False     # (False: no  | True: yes)\n","\n","# If running in colab:\n","#if RunInColab:\n","    # Mount your google drive in google colab\n","    #from google.colab import drive\n","    #drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","    # Find location\n","    #!pwd\n","    #!ls\n","    #!ls \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    #Ruta            = \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","Ruta = \"TC1002S/NotebooksStudents/A01642759\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"DXHHhj2jhjjg"},"outputs":[],"source":["# url string that hosts our .csv file\n","ruta_csv = \"~/escuela/semana_tec_analitica/TC1002S/NotebooksStudents/A01642759/iris/iris.data\"\n","# Read the .csv file and store it as a pandas Data Frame\n","col_names = [\"sepal length\", \"sepal width\", \"petal length\", \"petal width\", \"class\"]\n","df = pd.read_csv(ruta_csv,names=col_names)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hkKl8GApcJwL"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following: type(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{"id":"lBSUFAZ7cJwM"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sepal length</th>\n","      <th>sepal width</th>\n","      <th>petal length</th>\n","      <th>petal width</th>\n","      <th>class</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>5.1</td>\n","      <td>3.5</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","      <td>Iris-setosa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>4.9</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","      <td>Iris-setosa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>4.7</td>\n","      <td>3.2</td>\n","      <td>1.3</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","      <td>Iris-setosa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>4.6</td>\n","      <td>3.1</td>\n","      <td>1.5</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","      <td>Iris-setosa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>3.6</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","      <td>Iris-setosa</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   sepal length  sepal width  petal length  petal width        class\n","0           5.1          3.5           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","1           4.9          3.0           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","2           4.7          3.2           1.3          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","3           4.6          3.1           1.5          0.2  Iris-setosa\n","4           5.0          3.6           1.4          0.2  Iris-setosa"]},"execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["type(df)\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-TrO3YWShjjl"},"source":["# Exploring the content of the data set\n","\n","Use the `shape` method to determine the numbers of rows and columns in a data frame.
