The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`. \n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":55,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":56,"metadata":{"id":"QIpyBSfdcMjJ"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Define path del proyecto\n","path = r\"D:\\Escuela\\SextoSemestre\\SemanaTec\\TC1002S\\NotebooksStudents\\A01639678\\iris\\iris.csv\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":57,"metadata":{"id":"DXHHhj2jhjjg"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Read the .csv file and store it as a pandas Data Frame\n","df = pd.read_csv(path,header=0)\n","#First we have to add name to the columns, this information was contained in the iris.names file\n","df.columns = [\"slength\",\"swidth\",\"plength\",\"pwidth\",\"class\"]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hkKl8GApcJwL"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following: type(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":58,"metadata":{"id":"lBSUFAZ7cJwM"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["<class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'>\n"]}],"source":["print(type(df))"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-TrO3YWShjjl"},"source":["# Exploring the content of the data set\n","\n","Use the `shape` method to determine the numbers of rows and columns in a data frame.

Data Cleaning: handle with missing data\n","\n","Before getting started to work with your data, it's a good practice to observe it thoroughly to identify missing values and handle them accordingly.\n","\n","When reading a dataset using Pandas, there is a set of values including 'NA', 'NULL', and 'NaN' that are taken by default to represent a missing value.  The full list of default missing value codes is in the '`read_csv`' documentation [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html).  This document also explains how to change the way that '`read_csv`' decides whether a variable's value is missing.\n","\n","Pandas has functions called `isnull` and `notnull` that can be used to identify where the missing and non-missing values are located in a data frame.  \n","\n","Below we use these functions to count the number of missing and non-missing values in each variable of the
