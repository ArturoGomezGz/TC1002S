The **Pandas** library was developed to meet this need. **Pandas** is the most popular Python library for data manipulation, and we will use it extensively in this course. **Pandas** provides high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.\n","\n","The main data structure that **Pandas** works with is called a **Data Frame**. This is a two-dimensional table of data in which the rows typically\n","represent cases and the columns represent variables (e.g. data used in this tutorial).  Pandas also has a one-dimensional data structure called a **Series** that we will encounter when accesing a single column of a Data Frame.\n","\n","Pandas has a variety of functions named `read_xxx` for reading data in different formats.  Right now we will focus on reading `csv` files, which stands for comma-separated values. However the other file formats include `excel`, `json`, and `sql`. \n","\n","There are many other options to `read_csv` that are very useful.  For example, you would use the option `sep='\\t'` instead of the default `sep=','` if the fields of your data file are delimited by tabs instead of commas.  See [here](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.read_csv.html) for the full documentation for `read_csv`.\n","\n","\n","## Acknowledgments\n","\n","- The dataset used in this tutorial is from https://www.coursera.org/ from the course \"Understanding and Visualizing Data with Python\" by University of Michigan\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"b9FN-daXhjjT"},"source":["# Importing libraries\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"uRwVhX-YhjjU","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679491193003,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import the packages that we will be using\n","import pandas as pd"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MbGKgakihjjg"},"source":["# Importing data"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define where you are running the code: colab or local\n","RunInColab          = True     # (False: no  | True: yes)\n","\n","# If running in colab:\n","if RunInColab:\n","    # Mount your google drive in google colab\n","    from google.colab import drive\n","    drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","\n","    # Find location\n","    #!pwd\n","    #!ls\n","    #!ls \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/MachineLearningWithPython/\"\n","\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/TC1002S/NotebooksProfessor/\"\n","\n","else:\n","    # Define path del proyecto\n","    Ruta            = \"\""],"metadata":{"id":"QIpyBSfdcMjJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679491226617,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":28591,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}},"outputId":"5efb6652-1c8a-4e78-e8ac-442ffc129f10"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"DXHHhj2jhjjg","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679491387679,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":1700,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# url string that hosts our .csv file\n","url = Ruta + \"datasets/cartwheel/cartwheel.csv\"\n","\n","# Read the .csv file and store it as a pandas Data Frame\n","df  = pd.read_csv(url)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hkKl8GApcJwL"},"source":["If we want to print the information about th output object type we would simply type the following: type(df)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"id":"lBSUFAZ7cJwM","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679491403033,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}},"outputId":"00e907cf-c9b6-4127-8f1d-ed4ffdf719c3"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["pandas.core.frame.DataFrame"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["type(df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-TrO3YWShjjl"},"source":["# Exploring the content of the data set\n","\n","Use the `shape` method to determine the numbers of rows and columns in a data frame.

There are many different data types, but most commonly you will encounter floating point values (real numbers), integers, strings (text), and date/time values.  When Pandas reads a text/csv file, it guesses the data types based on what it sees in the first few rows of the data file.  Usually it selects an appropriate type, but occasionally it does not.  To confirm that the data types are consistent with what the variables represent, inspect the `dtypes` attribute of the data frame."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"E2aYPe4McJwT","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1679491802590,"user_tz":360,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Mauricio Antelis","userId":"11526682341763354036"}},"outputId":"ab3dec9f-2c0a-4bd6-a686-ceae4273d54c"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["ID                 int64\n","Age              float64\n","Gender            object\n","GenderGroup        int64\n","Glasses           object\n","GlassesGroup       int64\n","Height           float64\n","Wingspan         float64\n","CWDistance         int64\n","Complete          object\n","CompleteGroup    float64\n","Score              int64\n","dtype: object"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}],"source":["df.dtypes"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"6AGDxEK-cJwW"},"source":["Summary statistics, which include things like the mean, min, and max of the data, can be useful to get a feel for how large some of the variables are and what variables may be the most important.
